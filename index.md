**Command Option: -h**   
When you type in the command line and give it a patter. This command line will go through your directory and give you lines that contain that patttern.
However, this command line does not give you the name of the files. It will only display you a line that matched the patter. This becomes very useful
when you are looking for something but you are not sure what file you put it in but you don't need the files name you just want to know the sentence. 
This command becomes very useful for operations like that.  
**Command Option: -v**  
This command line will print out all the command line that does not math with the given patter. Command lines like this becomes very useful if you want
to narrow down your search to few lines. Lets say you are looking for for a specefic quote for a reading but you do not know where to find it.
Using this command you can now narrow down your search. Type in the pattern that you know for sure are not in your quote.
When you use this command it will show you the lines not containing the patter so you do not have to look at the enttirity of the reading. It makes your
life much easier.  
**Command Option: -C**  
This command liine will give you the total number of line before anf after the given patter. This command can come in very handy when you are editing 
some file and there is a word limit but you went over the word limit. Using this command you can give an specific line and you can either delete or keep
the line sbefore and after it. Which makes editing very easy. These are the scenarios that you can use these command in. They make your life much better.
