The command "cd ~" lets you change your directory or allowes you to move between directories/path. The commans "cd" works similar to cd ~, cd allows you to switch the current working directory to the given path. The command "ls -lat" gives you the list of all the files in your current direcory. It also gives the files name, date and other information. The command "ls -a" shows you the hidden files that are in the current directory. This command will only show you the files name. 
Now your done!!
